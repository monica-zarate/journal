"content": "Journaling about my adventures outdoors, new and old places I visit, a little bit of yoga and recipes. I’m an advocate of simple things, I found my mind and heart at ease when I’m close to nature. My occupational therapy is to cook and bake, and whenever my mind starts to get too cloudy, yoga is what the doctor recommended. Always trying to learn something new, and always looking for a new book to read. 32 years old, living in Beautiful British Columbia, Canada.",
